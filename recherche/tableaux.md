# Arrays in JavaScript

## ✅ What is an Array?
- An **Array** is an object type designed for storing **data collections**.
- An array can store **all types of data**: numbers, strings, arrays, objects, etc.
- The values stored in the array are known as **elements**.
- Arrays can **grow or shrink** as elements are added or removed.
- The **first element** is at **index 0**, the second at **index 1**, and so on.

## ✅ Syntax of an Array
```js
const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];
## Note
It is a common practice to declare arrays with the `const` keyword, but they can be declared using `var` or `let` too.

## Accessing Array Data
To access the array data, we call it by its index:

```js
const arr = ["red", "green", "blue"];
arr[1]; // "green"
